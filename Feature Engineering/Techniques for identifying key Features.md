Feature engineering improves the predictive power of machine learning models. Here are some approaches commonly used to find features that are meaningful contributors to the target:

1. **Univariate Feature Selection**

   This method involves evaluating each feature individually with respect to the target variable. Common statistical tests such as ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) or chi-square tests for categorical variables can be used to assess the relationship between each feature and the target. Features with significant p-values are considered important contributors.

2. **Feature Importance Techniques**:
   
   Ensemble methods such as Random Forests or Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs) can provide feature importance scores based on how much each feature decreases impurity in the model (e.g., Gini importance for decision trees). Features with higher importance scores are likely to be more influential in predicting the target.

3. **Correlation Analysis**: 

   Analyzing the correlation between each feature and the target can reveal linear relationships. Features with high correlation coefficients (either positive or negative) are likely to be strong contributors to the target.

4. **Domain Knowledge and Expertise**: 

   Subject matter experts or domain knowledge can provide valuable insights into which features are likely to be relevant to the target variable. Expertise can help identify meaningful predictors that may not be apparent from statistical analysis alone.

5. **Feature Engineering Techniques**: 

   Creating new features or transforming existing features based on domain knowledge or insights about the problem domain can lead to improved predictive performance. For example, creating interaction terms, polynomial features, or derived features from domain-specific knowledge can enhance model performance.

6. **Forward/Backward Feature Selection**: 

   These methods involve iteratively adding or removing features from the model based on their impact on model performance (e.g., using metrics like AIC or BIC). Forward selection starts with an empty set of features and adds the most predictive features one by one, while backward selection starts with all features and removes the least predictive ones iteratively.

7. **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**: 

   RFE is an iterative feature selection technique that starts with all features, builds a model, and then removes the least important features. This process continues until the desired number of features is reached. The importance of features is determined based on the coefficients of the model or their ranking in feature importance scores.
