In SQL, the "WHERE" clause is used to filter rows based on specified conditions, while the "HAVING" clause is used to filter groups in aggregate queries, such as those involving the "GROUP BY" clause. 

Typically, the "WHERE" clause is used with individual rows, while the "HAVING" clause is used with groups of rows. However, there are scenarios where you might use both "WHERE" and "HAVING" together in a single query.

Here's a general guideline:

1. Use the "WHERE" clause to filter rows based on specific conditions before grouping the data.
2. Use the "HAVING" clause to filter groups based on aggregate conditions after grouping the data.

For example, let's say you have a table of sales data and you want to find the total sales for each product category where the total sales are greater than 1000. You would use the "WHERE" clause to filter the rows based on specific conditions (e.g., date range, product category), and then use the "HAVING" clause to filter the groups based on aggregate conditions (e.g., total sales).

Here's an example query:

```
SELECT product_category, SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales_table
WHERE sales_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-09-09'
GROUP BY product_category
HAVING total_sales > 1000;
```

In this query, the "WHERE" clause filters the rows based on the sales date range, and the "HAVING" clause filters the groups based on the aggregate condition of total sales greater than 1000.

Remember, the "WHERE" clause is used for row-level filtering, and the "HAVING" clause is used for group-level filtering in aggregate queries.

The "HAVING" clause is used to filter groups in aggregate queries, such as those involving the "GROUP BY" clause. It allows you to specify conditions on the result of an aggregate function or expressions derived from the grouped data.

When you use the "HAVING" clause without the "WHERE" clause, it means that you want to filter the groups based on aggregate conditions only, without applying any row-level filtering.

Here's an example to illustrate the usage of the "HAVING" clause without the "WHERE" clause:

Let's say you have a table of sales data and you want to find the product categories with a total sales amount greater than 1000. You can use the "HAVING" clause to filter the groups based on the aggregate condition without applying any row-level filtering.

```sql
SELECT product_category, SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales_table
GROUP BY product_category
HAVING total_sales > 1000;
```

In this example, the "HAVING" clause is used to filter the groups based on the aggregate condition of total sales greater than 1000. Since there is no "WHERE" clause, all rows from the table are considered for aggregation.
