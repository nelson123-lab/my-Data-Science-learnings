## Fuzzy logic
Fuzzy logic is the process of converting the results from a binary output to a range of values between the absolute false and absolute true.

- The set of rules we define is based upon experiences. For example we are making a loan approval system based on the credit score. We need to have a set rules to determine the credit score vs the risk of loan approval.
- If we are deciding Good credit score as 750 and above, 650- 750 as Neutral and below 650 as bad. These values will be different for different banks as their criteria. We actually need some functions that can take a set of values than the crisp values for determing
  whether a person is having good, neutral and bad credit score. These functions are called **membership function** in fuzzy logic.
