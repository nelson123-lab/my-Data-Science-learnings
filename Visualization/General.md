- Both a countplot and a bar chart are used to visualize the distribution of categorical data. However, a countplot is specifically designed 
to show the count of observations in each categorical bin using bars, while a bar chart can be used to show any type of data, including categorical and 
numerical data.

## Scatter plot alternatives

- Hexbin plots bin the area of a chart into hexagonal regions. Each region is assigned a color intensity based on the method of aggregation used (the number of points, for instance).

- A KDE plot illustrates the distribution of a set of points in a two-dimensional space.

- A contour is created by connecting points of equal density. In other words, a single contour line depicts an equal density of data points.

## Bar plot alternatives

- Instead, you can replace them with Dot plots. They are like scatter plots but with one categorical and one continuous axis.

## Line/ Bar plot alternatives

- Instead, try Waterfall charts. The changes are automatically color-coded, making them easier to interpret.
