## Tableau Interview Questions with Solutions

1) What type of data have you worked with in Tableau ?
   - This question is basically to test our experience with Tableau. There are different types of data that Tableau support that includes Data, Data/Time, Numerical, Text, Geographical, Boolean etc. We have to frame our answer
     in a way that it includes at least some of the data types.

2) What types of connections can you make with datasets ?
   - There are mainly two different types of connections within tableau that is live connection and extracts.

3) How would you displaay the first 5 and last 5 records in a single view ?
   - A top 5 view and bottom 5 views are created and can be joined together to make a single view.

4) When would you use joins vs blends ?
   - Joins and blends are both techniques used to combine data from multiple tables or data sources in Tableau. The choice between joins and blends depends on the specific requirements of your analysis and the structure of       your data.
   - Joins are used when you want to combine data from different tables based on a common field or key. This is useful when you have related data in separate tables and want to create a single, unified view. Joins allow you       to merge the data horizontally, adding columns from one table to another.
   - On the other hand, blends are used when you want to combine data from different data sources without actually merging the data. Blends are useful when you have data from different sources that cannot be joined directly      due to different granularities or incompatible structures. Blends allow you to combine data vertically, creating a unified view without altering the original data sources.

5) Have you used Tableau stories ?
   - A Tableau Dashboard is a collection of visualizations, filters, and other interactive elements that are organized on a single canvas. Dashboards are designed to provide an overview of the data and allow users to             interact with the visualizations to explore the underlying data. Dashboards are typically used for real-time monitoring, data exploration, and providing a comprehensive view of the data.
   - On the other hand, a Tableau Story is a sequence of dashboards or visualizations that are presented in a specific order to tell a data-driven narrative. Stories allow you to guide your audience through a series of           insights or analysis by presenting dashboards in a logical flow. You can add annotations, captions, and descriptions to each dashboard in a story to provide context and highlight key findings. Stories are useful for         presenting a cohesive and structured analysis to stakeholders or for creating a narrative-driven data presentation.

6) What types of data do you include when you create dashboards ?
   - When creating dashboards, the types of data you include depend on the specific requirements of your analysis and the insights you want to convey. As a software engineer, I consider the following types of data when         creating dashboards:

   1. Quantitative Data: This includes numerical data such as sales figures, revenue, quantities, or any other measurable metrics. Quantitative data is often visualized using charts, graphs, or gauges to provide a clear       understanding of trends, patterns, and comparisons.

   2. Qualitative Data: This includes non-numerical data such as customer feedback, survey responses, or categorical information. Qualitative data can be represented using text, images, or icons to provide context and support the analysis.

   3. Time-Series Data: This type of data includes information that changes over time, such as daily sales, monthly website traffic, or yearly revenue. Time-series data is often visualized using line charts, area charts, or heatmaps to highlight trends, seasonality, or patterns over time.

   4. Geospatial Data: Geospatial data includes information related to geographic locations, such as customer locations, store locations, or regional sales data. Geospatial data can be visualized using maps, heatmaps, or choropleth maps to provide insights based on geographical context.

   5. Derived Metrics: Derived metrics are calculated or derived from existing data to provide additional insights. Examples include conversion rates, average order value, or customer lifetime value. Derived metrics can be used to create key performance indicators (KPIs) or to provide deeper analysis.

   6. Contextual Data: Contextual data includes any additional information that helps provide a comprehensive understanding of the analysis. This can include explanatory text, annotations, or reference data that supports the visualizations and helps users interpret the insights.

   It's important to carefully select and organize the data in your dashboards to ensure they effectively communicate the desired insights and support the decision-making process.

8) How would you structure a dashboard in Tableau ?
   - When structuring a dashboard in Tableau, it's important to consider the layout, organization, and visual hierarchy to create an intuitive and user-friendly experience. As a software engineer, here are some best practices for structuring a dashboard in Tableau:

   1. Define the Purpose: Clearly define the purpose and objective of your dashboard. Understand the key insights you want to convey and the target audience. This will help you determine the appropriate visualizations and data to include.

   2. Plan the Layout: Plan the layout of your dashboard by considering the available space and the number of visualizations you want to include. Use a grid system to align and position the visualizations consistently. Consider the placement of titles, filters, legends, and other interactive elements.

   3. Establish Visual Hierarchy: Establish a clear visual hierarchy to guide the user's attention. Place the most important and impactful visualizations prominently on the dashboard. Use size, color, and position to differentiate between primary and secondary visualizations.

   4. Use Filters and Interactivity: Incorporate filters and interactivity to allow users to explore the data and customize their view. Use parameters, quick filters, or interactive elements like drop-down menus to enable users to interact with the visualizations and drill down into specific details.

   5. Provide Context and Annotations: Add contextual information, annotations, or explanatory text to provide additional context and guide the interpretation of the visualizations. Use captions, titles, or text boxes to provide explanations, definitions, or insights related to the data.

   6. Ensure Consistency: Maintain consistency in terms of color schemes, fonts, and styles across the dashboard. This creates a cohesive and professional look and helps users navigate the dashboard more easily.

   7. Optimize Performance: Consider the performance of your dashboard by optimizing data sources, calculations, and filters. Use data extracts or aggregations to improve loading times, especially when dealing with large datasets.

   8. Test and Iterate: Test your dashboard with representative users to gather feedback and identify areas for improvement. Iterate on the design based on user feedback and make adjustments as necessary.

   By following these guidelines, you can create a well-structured and visually appealing dashboard in Tableau that effectively communicates insights and enhances the user experience.
