# Social Media metrices

These are the data points that show how well your social media strategy is performing.

1. Reach
   The number of people who see you content. By monitering the reach of individual post we will be able to identify the how the content is viewed according to the 
   content and the time at which it is being posted.
   eg: In instagram we can see for each posts whether our reach is more from followers or non-followers and depending on the hastags used the reach varies.

2. Impressions
   The number of time people saw your content. It will be more than reach because the same person can see the content multiple times. 
   eg: If your content is more attractive or more the interested with the viewers the chances of people viewing the content mulitple times are higher.
   
3. Audience growth rate
   Audience growth rate measures how many new followers your brand gets on social media within a certain amount of time.
   It is usually measured as percentage increase compared to your old followers.

4. Engagement Rate
   Engagement Rate measures the number of engagements (reactions, comments and shares) your content gets as a percentage of your audience.

5. Amplification rate
   Amplification Rate is the ratio of shares per post to the number of overall followers. Basically, the higher your amplification rate, the more your followers are    expanding your reach for you.

6. Virality rate
   -Measures how your content is spreading exponentially. Virality rate is similar to amplification rate in that it measures how much your content is shared.
