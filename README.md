# Social Media metrices

These are the data points that show how well your social media strategy is performing.

## Awareness metrics

1. Reach
   The number of people who see you content. By monitering the reach of individual post we will be able to identify the how the content is viewed according to the 
   content and the time at which it is being posted.
   eg: In instagram we can see for each posts whether our reach is more from followers or non-followers and depending on the hastags used the reach varies.

2. Impressions
   The number of time people saw your content. It will be more than reach because the same person can see the content multiple times. 
   eg: If your content is more attractive or more the interested with the viewers the chances of people viewing the content mulitple times are higher.
   
3. Audience growth rate
   Audience growth rate measures how many new followers your brand gets on social media within a certain amount of time.
   It is usually measured as percentage increase compared to your old followers.

## Engagement Metrices

1. Engagement Rate
   Engagement Rate measures the number of engagements (reactions, comments and shares) your content gets as a percentage of your audience.

2. Amplification rate
   Amplification Rate is the ratio of shares per post to the number of overall followers. Basically, the higher your amplification rate, the more your followers      are expanding your reach for you.

3. Virality rate
   -Measures how your content is spreading exponentially. Virality rate is similar to amplification rate in that it measures how much your content is shared.

## Video Metrices

1. Video views
   how many people are watching your videos. Each social network determines what counts as a “view”. even a few seconds of watch time counts as a “view.”
   
2. Video completion rate
   Shows how many people are actually completely watching your videos from start to finish. This shows your content is more engaging to the viewers.   

## Customer experience and service metrics

1. Customer satisfaction (CSAT) score
   Customer service metrics are not just about response times and response rates. CSAT (customer satisfaction score), is a metric that measures how happy 
   people are with your product or service.
   
2. Net promoter score (NPS)
   NPS, is a metric that measures customer loyalty.
   Unlike CSAT, NPS is good at predicting future customer relationships.

## ROI metrics

1. Click-through rate (CTR)
   Click-through rate, or CTR, is how often people click a link in your post to access additional content. That could be anything from a blog 
   post to your online store
   
2. Conversion rate
   Conversion rate measures how often your social content starts the process to a conversion event like a subscription, download, or sale. This is one of 
   the most important social media marketing metrics because it shows the value of your social content as a means of feeding your funnel.

3. Cost-per-click (CPC)
   Cost-per-click, or CPC, is the amount you pay per individual click on a social ad.
   
4. Cost per thousand impressions (CPM)
   Cost per thousand impressions, or CPM, is exactly what it sounds like. It’s the cost you pay for every thousand impressions of your social media ad.
   CPM is all about views, not actions.
