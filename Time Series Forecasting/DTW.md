## DTW (Dynamic Time Wrapping)

- To compare how similar two signals are ?
- Which points correspons to one another ?
- Can be used as distance metric for KNN to detemine which signal is having the least alignment cost.
- Can be used for classification and clustering of different time series signals.
- Can be used for anomaly detection by comparing the predicted signal and the actual signal. If the DTW distance is above a threshold we can determine it to have an anomaly.
