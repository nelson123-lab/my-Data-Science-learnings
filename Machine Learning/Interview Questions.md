WHat is Overfitting ?
- Overfitting is a common problem in machine learning where a model is trained too well on the training data, to the point that it starts to memorize the data         instead of learning the underlying patterns. This results in a model that performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data.

What is Regulariztion and what are the different types ?
- Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function of the model. This penalty term discourages the model from   fitting the training data too closely and encourages it to learn the underlying patterns instead. There are several regularization techniques, but two of the most   popular ones are L1 regularization and L2 regularization.
