# Assumpitons of Linear regressioon

1) Linear Relationship
   - The Linear regression assumptions that there is a linear relationship between the dependent variables and the independent variables.
2) Multiple Normality
   - This refers to the assumption of residuals. which are the differences between the observed values and the values predicted by the regression model, are normally distributed for each level of the independent variables.
3) No or little multicollinearity
   -  multicollinearity refers to the presence of high correlations between two or more independent variables in a regression model. When there is no or little multicollinearity, it means that the independent variables in the model are not highly correlated with each other
4) No auto-correlation
   - refers to the correlation between the residuals (errors) of a regression model and their own past values. No autocorrelation means that the residuals are not correlated with each other over time; they are independent.
5) Homoscedasticity
   - refers to the assumption that the variability (or spread) of the residuals is constant across all levels of the independent variable(s). In simpler terms, it means that the spread of the residuals should be roughly the same for all values of the predictor variables.
