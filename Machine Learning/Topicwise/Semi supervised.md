- Semi-supervised machine learning is a type of machine learning where a model is trained on a combination of labeled and unlabeled data. 
  In traditional supervised learning, the model is trained using labeled data, where each data point is associated with a corresponding 
  target label. However, in semi-supervised learning, only a subset of the data is labeled, while the majority of the data remains unlabeled.

- The labeled data is used to guide the learning process and provide a basis for the model to make predictions. The unlabeled data, on 
  the other hand, helps the model to learn the underlying patterns and structure of the data. By leveraging both labeled and unlabeled 
  data, semi-supervised learning aims to improve the model's performance and generalization ability.

- Semi-supervised learning can be particularly useful in scenarios where obtaining labeled data is expensive or time-consuming. It allows
  the model to make use of the large amounts of unlabeled data that are often readily available. Techniques such as self-training,
  co-training, and generative models are commonly used in semi-supervised learning to make the most of the available data.

- It's important to note that while semi-supervised learning can be beneficial, it also introduces additional challenges. The model
  needs to effectively handle the uncertainty associated with the unlabeled data and avoid overfitting to the labeled data. Additionally,
  the quality and representativeness of the labeled and unlabeled data can significantly impact the performance of the model.
