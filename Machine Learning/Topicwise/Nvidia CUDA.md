# CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture)

- CUDA is particularly beneficial for tasks that involve heavy parallel computations, large datasets, and where traditional CPU-based processing may be limiting in terms of performance.
- CUDA allows developers to write code in a language like C/C++ and annotate it with special directives to indicate which parts of the code should execute on the CPU and which should execute on the GPU.
- Frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and MXNet utilize CUDA to leverage the parallel processing power of GPUs.
- NVIDIA provides a CUDA Toolkit, which includes everything needed to develop CUDA applications. This toolkit includes libraries, compiler tools, debugging tools, and GPU-accelerated math libraries like cuBLAS and cuDNN.
