## RNN ( Recurrent Neural Network )
- A type of Neural network architecture that can handle sequential data well. This is acheived by the use of feedback loops within the network.
- There are several types of RNN.

## Time Step and Hidden State


## Different types of RNN.
- Sequence to Sequence (price forecasting)
- Sequence to Vector (Scam or not scam)
- Vector to sequence (Image Captioning)
- Encoder-decoder (Language Translation)

## Shortcomings of RNN
- Unstable gradients( Vanishing gradient descent problem)
- RNN tends to forget the informaation about the beginning of the sentence when long sentences are provided to it.
