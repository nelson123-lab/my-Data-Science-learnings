# The main components of a Machine learning

1. Machine learning Model
    - A block of codes used to solve different problems.
3. Model Training Algorithm
    - Depending on the data the training algorithm is choosen. Some of them gives better results in minimal amount of time.
    - An iterative process
3. Model Inference Algorithm
    - Processes to use a trained model to solve a task.
    - Using the developed model to make predictions on the real data.
