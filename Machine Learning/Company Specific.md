How would you approach A/B testing at Lyft?

- A/B testing is a common technique used to measure the effectiveness of different versions of a product or service. 
- At Lyft, I would begin by identifying the key metrics that we want to improve, such as user engagement or retention. Then, I would design a test that randomly assigns users to either the control or experimental group,       where the control group uses the existing product and the experimental group uses the new version. I would set a statistical significance level and sample size, and then run the test for a sufficient duration to collect     enough data. 
- Finally, I would use statistical analysis to compare the results of the two groups and determine if the new version of the product is statistically significant better than the existing one.
