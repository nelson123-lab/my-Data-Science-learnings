What is collaborative filtering recommendation system?
- Collaborative filtering is a technique used in recommender systems to generate recommendations for users based on their past behavior and the behavior of similar 
  users. The idea behind collaborative filtering is that people who have agreed in the past will agree in the future, and that they will like similar kinds of items 
  as they liked in the past.

- Collaborative filtering approaches build a model from a user's past behavior, such as items previously purchased or selected, and/or numerical ratings given to 
  those items, as well as similar decisions made by other users. This model is then used to predict items (or ratings for items) that the user may have an interest 
  in.

- Collaborative filtering methods are classified as memory-based and model-based. Memory-based approaches, such as the user-based algorithm, locate peer users/items 
  with a rating history similar to the current user or item, and generate recommendations using this neighborhood. Model-based approaches, such as matrix 
  factorization, use machine learning algorithms to learn the latent factors that explain the observed ratings and predict the missing ones.

- Collaborative filtering is widely used in recommender systems, and it can be combined with other techniques such as content-based filtering and knowledge-based 
  filtering to improve the quality of recommendations.

What is content based filtering?

- Content-based filtering is a type of recommender system that makes recommendations based on the characteristics of the items themselves. In content-based 
  filtering, the system analyzes the features of the items that a user has interacted with in the past, such as the genre of a movie or the author of a book, and 
  then recommends other items with similar features.

- For example, if a user has watched and enjoyed several action movies, a content-based filtering system might recommend other action movies with similar themes, 
  actors, or directors. Similarly, if a user has purchased several books by a particular author, a content-based filtering system might recommend other books by 
  the same author or books with similar themes or writing styles.

- Content-based filtering is useful when there is a lot of information available about the items being recommended, but little information about the user's 
  preferences. It is also useful when the items being recommended are similar in nature, such as movies or books.
