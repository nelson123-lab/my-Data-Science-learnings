What is collaborative filtering recommendation system?
- Collaborative filtering is a technique used in recommender systems to generate recommendations for users based on their past behavior and the behavior of similar 
  users. The idea behind collaborative filtering is that people who have agreed in the past will agree in the future, and that they will like similar kinds of items 
  as they liked in the past.

- Collaborative filtering approaches build a model from a user's past behavior, such as items previously purchased or selected, and/or numerical ratings given to 
  those items, as well as similar decisions made by other users. This model is then used to predict items (or ratings for items) that the user may have an interest 
  in.

- Collaborative filtering methods are classified as memory-based and model-based. Memory-based approaches, such as the user-based algorithm, locate peer users/items 
  with a rating history similar to the current user or item, and generate recommendations using this neighborhood. Model-based approaches, such as matrix 
  factorization, use machine learning algorithms to learn the latent factors that explain the observed ratings and predict the missing ones.

- Collaborative filtering is widely used in recommender systems, and it can be combined with other techniques such as content-based filtering and knowledge-based 
  filtering to improve the quality of recommendations.
