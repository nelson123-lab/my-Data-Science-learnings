**Setting Metrics for A/B Test:**

1. **Importance of Metrics:**
   - Metrics are crucial for successful A/B tests, helping validate hypotheses and aligning with overall business goals.

2. **Driver Tree:**
   - A visual tool to understand how different metrics and levers in an organization fit together.
   - Helps identify strategic initiatives for high impact and facilitates prioritization.

3. **Types of Metrics:**
   - **Goal Metrics:**
     - Aligned with long-term company vision.
     - Examples: revenue, adoption, engagement, performance.
     - Typically stable over time, not suitable for short-term experiments.

   - **Driver Metrics:**
     - Leading indicators of product success.
     - Surrogate or indirect metrics.
     - Chosen metrics should directly drive goal metrics.

   - **Guardrail Metrics:**
     - Ensure new features don't negatively impact the company.
     - Act as a sanity check for experiments.

   - **Diagnostic Metrics:**
     - Help understand why goal metrics move or don't move.
     - Aid in interpreting the impact of experiments.

4. **Overall Evaluation Criteria (OEC):**
   - Combines weighted metrics into a single metric for overall decision-making.
   - Advantages include stability and comprehensive decision-making.
   - Combining 3-5 metrics in an OEC is typically recommended.

5. **Building OEC:**
   - Designing experiments involves optimizing multiple metrics.
   - OEC prevents gaming of individual metrics and ensures a holistic view.
   - Combining short-term and long-term outcomes in decision-making.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Online experiments are essential for causality in data-driven companies.
   - Metric strategy is closely tied to experiment design.
   - Types of metrics include goal, driver, guardrail, and diagnostic metrics.
   - OEC combines multiple metrics for stable and comprehensive decision-making.
