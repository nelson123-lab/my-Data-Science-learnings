AWS boto3 is a python library that allows to interact with various AWS services programmatically. With boto3, we can easily automate tasks, manage resources, and build applications that leverage the power of AWS.

To get started with boto3, you'll need to have the AWS SDK for Python (boto3) installed. You can install it using pip, the Python package manager, by running the command `pip install boto3`.

Once you have boto3 installed, you'll need to configure your AWS credentials. This involves providing your access key ID and secret access key, which you can obtain from the AWS Management Console. You can configure your credentials using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) or by setting environment variables.

After configuring your credentials, you can start using boto3 to interact with AWS services. You'll typically begin by creating a client or resource object for the specific service you want to work with. For example, to interact with Amazon S3, you can create an S3 client like this:

```python
import boto3

s3_client = boto3.client('s3')
```

Once you have the client object, you can use its methods to perform various operations on the service. For example, you can upload files to S3, create buckets, list objects, and much more.

Boto3 follows a consistent and intuitive API design across different AWS services, making it easier to work with multiple services in a unified manner. The library also provides comprehensive documentation and code examples, which can be incredibly helpful when you're getting started or exploring new features.
