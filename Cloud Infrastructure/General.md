Google BigQuery and Azure SQL are both popular cloud-based data storage and analytics platforms, but they have some key differences in terms of features, architecture, and integration with their respective cloud ecosystems. Let's explore each of them:

Google BigQuery:
- Architecture: BigQuery is a serverless, fully managed data warehouse offered by Google Cloud. It is designed to handle large-scale data processing and analytics using a distributed computing model. BigQuery automatically scales resources based on the workload, allowing you to focus on analyzing data rather than managing infrastructure.
- Querying: BigQuery uses a SQL-like language called BigQuery SQL for querying data. It supports standard SQL syntax and provides extensions for working with nested and repeated data structures. BigQuery's columnar storage and highly parallelized execution engine enable fast query performance, especially for large datasets.
- Integration: BigQuery integrates well with other Google Cloud services, such as Google Data Studio for visualization, Cloud Storage for data import/export, and Cloud Dataflow for data processing pipelines. It also supports integrations with popular data integration and ETL tools.
- Pricing: BigQuery offers a flexible pricing model based on data storage, data transfer, and query usage. It provides on-demand and flat-rate pricing options to suit different usage patterns.

Azure SQL:
- Architecture: Azure SQL is a family of managed relational database services provided by Microsoft Azure. It includes Azure SQL Database, which is a fully managed database-as-a-service (DBaaS), and Azure SQL Managed Instance, which provides a dedicated instance of SQL Server in the Azure cloud. Azure SQL offers high availability, automatic backups, and built-in security features.
- Querying: Azure SQL supports the Transact-SQL (T-SQL) language, which is an extension of the SQL standard. T-SQL provides additional features and capabilities specific to Microsoft SQL Server. Azure SQL also supports in-memory OLTP and columnstore indexes for improved query performance.
- Integration: Azure SQL integrates well with other Azure services, such as Azure Data Factory for data integration, Azure Analysis Services for multidimensional analytics, and Power BI for visualization. It also supports integration with on-premises SQL Server instances using hybrid connectivity options.
- Pricing: Azure SQL offers various pricing tiers based on performance, storage, and features. It provides options for single databases, elastic pools for resource sharing, and managed instances for greater compatibility with on-premises SQL Server deployments.

When choosing between Google BigQuery and Azure SQL, it's important to consider factors such as your specific requirements, existing cloud ecosystem, integration needs, and budget. Both platforms offer robust capabilities for data storage and analytics, so evaluating your use case and conducting a thorough comparison can help you make an informed decision.
