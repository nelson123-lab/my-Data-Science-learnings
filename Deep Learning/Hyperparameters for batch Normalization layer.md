What are the hyperparameters that can be optimized for batch normalization layer?

Batch Normalization is a technique used to improve the training and performance of neural networks. While the core functionality of Batch Normalization is not controlled by hyperparameters, there are a few hyperparameters associated with Batch Normalization that can be optimized:

1. Momentum: The momentum hyperparameter controls the exponential moving average of the mean and variance estimates in Batch Normalization. It determines how much of the previous estimates are retained when updating the current estimates. The optimal value for momentum depends on the specific problem and dataset, and it can be tuned to achieve better performance.

2. Epsilon: The epsilon hyperparameter is a small value added to the variance estimate in the denominator to avoid division by zero. It ensures numerical stability during the normalization process. The default value of epsilon is typically small (e.g., 1e-5), but it can be adjusted if necessary.

3. Gamma and Beta: Gamma and Beta are learnable parameters in Batch Normalization that allow the network to scale and shift the normalized values, respectively. These parameters are updated during training. While not strictly hyperparameters, they can be optimized through the training process to find the best values for the specific task.

It's worth noting that the default values for these hyperparameters often work well in practice. However, depending on the dataset and network architecture, fine-tuning these hyperparameters may lead to improved performance. It's recommended to experiment with different values and monitor the impact on the training and validation performance to find the optimal configuration for your specific task.
