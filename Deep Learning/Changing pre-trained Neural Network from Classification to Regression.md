How can we change a pre-trained Neural Network from classification to Regression?

To change a pre-trained neural network from classification to regression, you need to make a few modifications to the network architecture and the output layer. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Modify the output layer: In a classification network, the output layer typically consists of softmax activation and produces probabilities for each class. For regression, you need to change the output layer to a single neuron without any activation function. This allows the network to directly output a continuous value.

2. Adjust the loss function: In classification, the commonly used loss function is categorical cross-entropy. For regression, you'll need to choose an appropriate loss function based on your specific regression task. Common choices include mean squared error (MSE) or mean absolute error (MAE).

3. Adjust the data labels: In classification, the labels are typically one-hot encoded vectors representing the class of each sample. In regression, the labels should be continuous values corresponding to the target variable you want to predict. Make sure to adjust your training data labels accordingly.

4. Fine-tune the network: Depending on the complexity of your regression task and the similarity to the original classification task, you may need to fine-tune the pre-trained network. This involves retraining the network on your regression data while keeping the pre-trained weights frozen or updating them with a smaller learning rate. Fine-tuning helps the network adapt to the new task while leveraging the knowledge learned from the pre-training.

5. Adjust evaluation metrics: In classification, accuracy is commonly used as an evaluation metric. For regression, you'll need to choose appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), or R-squared to assess the performance of your regression model.

Remember to validate and test your modified network thoroughly to ensure it performs well on your regression task. It's also important to have an appropriate dataset with labeled continuous values for regression training.
