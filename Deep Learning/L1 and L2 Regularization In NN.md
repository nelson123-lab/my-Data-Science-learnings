How does L1 and L2 regularization affect Neural Network?

L1 and L2 regularization are techniques used to prevent overfitting in neural networks by adding a regularization term to the loss function during training. Here's how L1 and L2 regularization affect neural networks:

1. L1 Regularization (Lasso Regularization):
L1 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the absolute value of the weights in the network. This encourages the model to learn sparse representations by driving some of the weights to zero. As a result, L1 regularization can help with feature selection and reduce the complexity of the model. It can be particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional data or when there is a need to interpret the importance of individual features.

2. L2 Regularization (Ridge Regularization):
L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the weights in the network. This encourages the model to distribute the weight values more evenly across all the features. L2 regularization helps prevent overfitting by reducing the magnitude of the weights, effectively shrinking them towards zero. It can improve the generalization ability of the model and make it less sensitive to small changes in the input data.

Both L1 and L2 regularization techniques help control the complexity of the model and prevent overfitting. By adding a regularization term to the loss function, they introduce a trade-off between fitting the training data well and keeping the model weights small. The choice between L1 and L2 regularization depends on the specific problem and the desired characteristics of the model. Experimentation and tuning are often necessary to find the optimal regularization strength for a given neural network.
