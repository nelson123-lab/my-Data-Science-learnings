- An activation function is a mathematical function that introduces non-linearity into a neural network. It is applied to the output of each neuron in a neural network layer, allowing the network to learn complex patterns and make non-linear transformations on the input data.

- The use of an activation function is crucial in neural networks for several reasons:

1. Non-linearity: Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the network, enabling it to learn and model complex relationships between inputs and outputs. Without non-linear activation functions, a neural network would be limited to representing only linear functions, severely restricting its learning capabilities.

2. Gradient propagation: Activation functions help propagate gradients backward through the network during the training process. The gradients are used to update the weights and biases of the network through backpropagation, allowing the network to learn and improve its performance over time.

3. Output range: Activation functions can constrain the output of a neuron within a specific range. This can be useful in scenarios where the output needs to be bounded, such as in classification tasks where probabilities are required.

- Here are three different types of activation functions commonly used in neural networks:

Sigmoid Activation Function: The sigmoid function, also known as the logistic function, maps the input to a value between 0 and 1. It is defined as f(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x)). Sigmoid functions are useful in binary classification tasks where the output needs to be interpreted as a probability.
Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU): The ReLU activation function is defined as f(x) = max(0, x). It returns the input value if it is positive, and zero otherwise. ReLU is widely used in deep learning due to its simplicity and ability to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem. It helps the network learn faster and can improve its performance.
Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh) Activation Function: The tanh function maps the input to a value between -1 and 1. It is defined as f(x) = (e^x - e^(-x)) / (e^x + e^(-x)). Tanh functions are similar to sigmoid functions but have a range from -1 to 1. They are useful in scenarios where the output needs to be centered around zero, such as in image classification tasks.
