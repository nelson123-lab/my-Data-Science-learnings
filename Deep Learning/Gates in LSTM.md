what are the main gates in LSTM and what are their tasks?

In Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, there are three main gates: the input gate, the forget gate, and the output gate. Each gate performs a specific task in the LSTM architecture.

1. Input Gate: The input gate determines how much information from the current input should be stored in the cell state. It takes the current input and the previous hidden state as inputs and applies a sigmoid activation function. This gate controls the flow of information into the cell state.

2. Forget Gate: The forget gate decides what information should be discarded from the cell state. It takes the current input and the previous hidden state as inputs and applies a sigmoid activation function. The output of the forget gate is multiplied element-wise with the previous cell state, allowing the LSTM to forget irrelevant information.

3. Output Gate: The output gate determines the amount of information to be output from the cell state. It takes the current input and the previous hidden state as inputs and applies a sigmoid activation function. Additionally, it applies a tanh activation function to the current cell state. The output gate then combines the results of these two activations to produce the current hidden state.

These gates work together to control the flow of information in an LSTM network, allowing it to selectively remember or forget information over time. This enables LSTMs to effectively capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.
