How to know whether you model is suffereing from the problem of Exploding Gradients?

To determine whether your model is suffering from the problem of exploding gradients, you can look for the following signs:

1. Loss Divergence: If you observe that the loss function increases rapidly during training or becomes NaN (not a number), it indicates that the gradients have exploded. This is a clear indication of the exploding gradient problem.

2. Oscillating or Unstable Training: If the training process is unstable, with the model's performance fluctuating significantly between epochs, it could be a sign of exploding gradients. The model may struggle to converge or fail to improve consistently.

3. Extremely Large Gradient Values: You can inspect the gradient values during training. If you notice that the gradients are consistently very large, it suggests that the gradients are exploding. You can monitor the gradients by logging or visualizing them during training.

4. NaN or Infinite Parameter Values: If the weights or biases of your model become NaN or infinite during training, it is a strong indication of exploding gradients. This can happen when the gradients are too large and cause the parameter values to blow up.

5. Unstable or Incorrect Predictions: Exploding gradients can lead to unstable or incorrect predictions. If your model's predictions are inconsistent or significantly deviate from the expected results, it could be due to the gradients becoming too large and causing the model to make erroneous updates.

If you suspect that your model is suffering from the problem of exploding gradients, there are several steps you can take to address it. These include:

1. Gradient Clipping: Apply gradient clipping, which involves setting a threshold on the gradient values. If the gradients exceed the threshold, they are scaled down to prevent them from becoming too large.

2. Weight Initialization: Properly initialize the weights of your model. Using initialization techniques like Xavier or He initialization can help alleviate the problem of exploding gradients by ensuring that the initial weights are within a reasonable range.

3. Learning Rate Adjustment: Reduce the learning rate of your optimizer. A high learning rate can exacerbate the problem of exploding gradients. Gradually decreasing the learning rate or using adaptive learning rate algorithms can help stabilize the training process.

4. Batch Normalization: Implement batch normalization, as discussed earlier. Batch normalization can help mitigate the issue of exploding gradients by normalizing the inputs to each layer and ensuring that the gradients flow smoothly through the network.

By monitoring the signs mentioned above and applying appropriate techniques, you can effectively address the problem of exploding gradients and stabilize the training process of your model.
