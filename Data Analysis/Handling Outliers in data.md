Box plot can be used for identifiying the outliers in the dataset.

1) **Z Score:**
   - **Use for Identifying Outliers:** Z Score is a measure of how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. Typically, if the absolute Z score of a data point is above a certain threshold (commonly 2 or 3), it is considered an outlier. High Z scores indicate values far from the mean.

2) **Interquartile Range (IQR):**
   - **Use for Identifying Outliers:** IQR is the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) of a dataset. Outliers can be identified using the IQR method by considering values outside the range [Q1 - 1.5 * IQR, Q3 + 1.5 * IQR] as potential outliers. This method is less sensitive to extreme values than the range-based methods.

3) **Isolation Forest:**
   - **Use for Identifying Outliers:** Isolation Forest is a machine learning algorithm that isolates outliers by building a tree structure. Outliers are identified as instances that require fewer steps in the tree structure to be isolated. Points that are isolated earlier in the tree are considered more likely to be outliers.

4) **Winsorizing:**
   - **Use for Identifying Outliers:** Winsorizing is a data transformation technique that involves replacing extreme values with less extreme values. Instead of removing outliers, Winsorizing caps or truncates extreme values by setting them to a specified percentile value. This helps to reduce the impact of extreme values on statistical analyses.

5) **Visualization:**
   - **Use for Identifying Outliers:** Visualization techniques involve creating plots or charts to visually inspect data. Common visualizations for outlier detection include box plots, scatter plots, and histograms. Outliers can be identified by observing data points that fall outside the expected patterns or clusters. Visualization is a powerful exploratory tool for identifying outliers but may not be as precise as statistical methods.
