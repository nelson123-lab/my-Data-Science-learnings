## Dask

- A flexible library for parallel computing in Python. ( Python only )
- Bridges the gap between the pandas and Apache Spark. Dask can support large datasets that pandas can support. (Large data handling capability -- pandas > Dask > Spark ).
- Can work locally and scale up to the cloud when needed.
- Lazy execution we need to force it each time using the compute command.
