# KPI (Key perfromance Indicator)
- KPIs are measurable values in business that demonstrate how effectively a company is achieving its key business objectives.
- These indicators vary depending on the organization's goals and may cover various areas such as sales, marketing, customer service, finance, operations, and more.
- KPIs are used to evaluate the success of a company or a specific activity within the company and are crucial for monitoring progress, identifying areas for improvement, and making informed decisions to drive performance and growth.

## Finance 

1. **Revenue**: This is the total income generated by a business from its normal activities, usually from selling goods or services to customers.

   *Example in Data Science*: In a retail data analysis project, you might use revenue data to predict future sales based on historical patterns, customer behavior, and economic factors.

2. **COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)**: This represents the direct costs incurred in producing goods or services that a company sells. It includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead.

   *Example in Data Science*: When analyzing manufacturing efficiency, you could build a model to optimize COGS by identifying factors that influence production costs and using predictive analytics to forecast cost fluctuations.

3. **Gross Margin %**: This is the percentage of revenue that exceeds the COGS. It's a measure of how efficiently a company produces goods or services before considering other operating expenses.

   *Example in Data Science*: In a profitability analysis, you might use gross margin % to assess the financial health of different product lines or businesses within a company and identify opportunities for cost savings or revenue improvement.
