### What is Generative AI?

Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that can create new content, such as text, images, audio, and video. It does 
this by learning from existing data and then using that knowledge to generate new and unique outputs.

### What is an example of both a generative AI model and a discriminative AI model?

A generative AI model could be trained on a dataset of images of cats and then used to generate new images of cats. A discriminative AI 
model could be trained on a dataset of images of cats and dogs and then used to classify new images as either cats or dogs.

### What is prompt?

A prompt is a short piece of text that is given to the large language model as input, and it can be used to control the output of the model in many ways.

## What is meant by Foundation Models?

A foundation model is a large AI model pretrained on a vast quantity of data that was "designed to be adapted‚Äù (or fine-tuned) to a wide range of downstream tasks, such as sentiment analysis, image captioning, and object recognition.
