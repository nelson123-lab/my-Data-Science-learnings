### What is Generative AI?

Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that can create new content, such as text, images, audio, and video. It does 
this by learning from existing data and then using that knowledge to generate new and unique outputs.

### What is an example of both a generative AI model and a discriminative AI model?

A generative AI model could be trained on a dataset of images of cats and then used to generate new images of cats. A discriminative AI 
model could be trained on a dataset of images of cats and dogs and then used to classify new images as either cats or dogs.
